    "text": "Welcome to My Car Sales Data Analysis Project This website presents a comprehensive analysis of car sales data from the year 2000 onward. Inside, you’ll find interactive visualizations and clear summaries highlighting key trends in the automotive market—such as the most popular car colors, top-selling vehicle features, and year-over-year changes in consumer preferences. Explore the Data Analysis section for detailed graphs and insights, check out the Sources page for data provenance, and visit the About section to learn more about the purpose and scope of this project.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation of the Graph: Total Units Sold Over Time The line graph displays the total number of units sold each year from approximately 1999 to 2024. Each red dot represents the units sold in a given year, and the connecting blue line illustrates the trend over time.\nThe data shows significant year-to-year fluctuations in units sold, indicating a market with varying demand or external influences. While there are occasional peaks—such as around 2002, 2006, and 2022—these are often followed by noticeable declines. The highest point appears in 2002, where sales exceeded 2.1 million units, suggesting a particularly strong performance that year.\nIn contrast, there are notable drops in sales around 2000, 2013, and 2019–2020. The dip in 2019 could reflect broader market disruptions or internal company challenges. Interestingly, after a low point in 2020, there is a brief recovery in 2021–2022, followed by another decline into 2023 and 2024.\nOverall, the graph suggests a cyclical or unstable sales pattern rather than steady growth or decline. This volatility may point to seasonal trends, changes in consumer preferences, or impacts from economic or global events. Identifying the causes of these fluctuations would be important for future forecasting and strategic planning."

    "text": "This graph shows a clear trend: the average price of cars has been steadily increasing every 5 years, from 25.000 in 2000 to 37,500 in 2025—a 50% jump in just 25 years.\nKey Reasons for Rising Prices:\nTechnology & Features Modern cars now include advanced safety systems (automatic braking, lane assist), touchscreen infotainment, and hybrid/electric options—all adding to the cost.\nInflation & Production Costs\nMaterials (steel, aluminum, lithium for batteries) and labor costs have risen over time. Stricter emissions and safety regulations require expensive engineering.\nConsumer Preferences\nBuyers want SUVs and trucks (which cost more than small cars). Luxury brands and premium features are in higher demand.\nSupply Chain Issues\nEvents like the pandemic and chip shortages (2020–2022) disrupted production, pushing prices higher.\nWhat This Means for You:\nNew cars are becoming a bigger investment. Many buyers now opt for longer loans (6–7 years) or used vehicles.\nElectric cars, while pricier upfront, may save money on fuel and maintenance long-term.\nLeasing or subscriptions are growing as alternatives to buying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows which fuel types (Diesel, Electric, Hybrid, Petrol) were the most sold in different countries (Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, UK, USA) from 2000 to 2024.\nKey Trends to Notice: Early 2000s (2000–2010):\nPetrol (gasoline) and Diesel were dominant in most countries.\nDiesel was especially popular in Europe (France, Germany, Italy, UK).\n2010s (2010–2020):\nHybrid cars (like Toyota Prius) grew in popularity, especially in Japan and the USA.\nElectric cars (EVs) started appearing but were still rare.\n2020s (2020–2024):\nElectric cars (EVs) surged due to better technology, government incentives, and environmental awareness.\nDiesel sales dropped in Europe due to pollution concerns.\nHybrids remained strong as a transition option.\nWhat This Means: Petrol (Gasoline) was the default choice, but electric and hybrid cars are taking over.\nEurope moved from Diesel → Electric.\nUSA & Japan shifted from Petrol → Hybrid → Electric.\nRussia still relies more on Petrol/Diesel (slower EV adoption).\nFuture Prediction: Electric cars will likely become the #1 fuel type in most countries by 2030.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis graph shows how many cars were sold based on their horsepower (HP) and safety ratings (A, B, C, D), where:\nA = Best safety | B = Good | C = Average | D = Poor\nHP ranges span from 100 HP to 400+ HP\nKey Trends:\nMost Popular Horsepower Range:\nThe majority of cars sold fall in the 150–250 HP range.\nThis balances power, fuel efficiency, and affordability for everyday drivers.\nSafety vs. Performance:\nHighest sales are in A/B-rated cars with moderate HP (150–250)—safety matters most to average buyers.\nHigh-HP cars (300+ HP) sell in smaller numbers and often have lower safety ratings (C/D)—common in sports/luxury vehicles.\nLow-HP cars (&lt;150 HP) may prioritize fuel economy but vary in safety.\nMarket Preferences:\nFamily/commuter cars: High safety (A/B) + mid-range HP.\nPerformance cars: High HP (300+) but often trade safety for speed.\nBudget cars: Lower HP + mixed safety ratings.\nWhat This Means for Buyers: ✔ Need a safe, practical car? Look for A/B ratings with 150–250 HP. ✔ Want speed? High-HP cars exist but may cost more and compromise safety. ✔ Shopping on a budget? Lower HP options are available, but check safety ratings carefully.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA bar chart displaying the top-selling car color for each year based on total units sold."
